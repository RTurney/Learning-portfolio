## Weekly reflection: 

Overall I am really happy with the end result of our two week project. 
We had planned quite an ambitious project overall considering we had never worked with React or with mobile app development before. 

However, the end result worked very well and we managed to implement so many features that we had to reduce them all for the demo. 

Unfortunately I was disappointed that we did not work through this project with TDD and due to working on a mobile platform, could not set up a CI pipeline. 
Our main issue with TDD was that we were nevera able to get the testing infrastructure set up correctly. We understood that Jest was the best platform for testing React Native projects however, mocking was a major issue for us. After a while of not being successful, we had moved too far ahead with the rest of the project to set up testing and start TDD-ing newer features. Personally this was a bit disappoint for me, as would rather have been much more thorough with our process for this project. But the end result works well so I should not kick myself too much about it.

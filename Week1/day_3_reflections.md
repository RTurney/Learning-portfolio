# Day 3 reflections

## Goals
* [x] Learn about self-led learning 
* [x] Understand debugging
* [ ] Boris bikes challenge 

## Reflections

-> I feel as though I have understood the process of debugging but I will need to ensure that it is almost an automatic response for when I run into any issues. 

-> I finally understood the difference in feature and unit tests and the process of switching between them as you develop your code. 

-> I enjoyed the process of self-led learning but I think I need to get better at creating SMART goals. This will only help my ability to create and assess my own goals. 

-> I have a better understanding of sharing github repos and working together with multiple collaborators. 

-> Learnt about raising your own errors in your code using **raise** and **error**

-> Learnt about running rspec tests that expect errors

-> Finally understood the point and how to use an **attr_accessor** 

-> Overall, a better understanding of rspec tests, particulary using the 'subject' keyword as a standin for a class instance.

# Day 1 reflections

## Goals: 
There were no outstanding goals for this day. 

## Reflections from the day:
-> Alot of the talks today covered what our time at Makers will be like over the following weeks. 
   One thing which we were told about was 'self-led learning'. It seems this will be the method by which we will be learning throughout this course: 

  “...a process by which individuals take the initiative, with or without the assistance of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes”

   This approach to learning seems to put the responsibility on the learner to set goals for their own learning, as well as assessing whether these goals have been adequetly met. 
   I think I will have to take the time each morning to plan what *exactly* my goals are for that day and then to plan *how* I will accomplish them. 

-> Another thing which caught my attention was that the coaches stated that they **purposefully** provide us with too many tasks to accomplish. 
   The point is that we are *not* supposed to complete them all. Additionally the main takeaway is that the goal is **not completing tasks but thinking about and identifying what we are learning from each one**
   
   What this means for me is that I need to **concentrate on what each task I do is trying to teach me**
  
-> Meditation and yoga is important with multiple positive effects. I should try to take part in both whenever I can. 

-> Some further lessons that I will need to take forward with me is to: 
  * enjoy my time here!
  * focus on my own learning and don't compare myself to anyone else 
  * I belong here

# Day 6 reflections


## Goals
* [ ] Boris bike challenge

## Reflections

* I managed to move through a number of the challenges by myself on Saturday, however I was unable to finish the challenge completely. Being left to my own devices while doing the TDD cycle to introduce two new objects was difficult. 

* I have learnt that is important to plan your code ahead of time. This will help with introducing changes as well as planning how your tests will work and how objects will interact with each other

* I learnt about single responsibility principle and enacted that in my own code. 

* I learnt about using doubles in your rspec tests to help isolate your tests

# Day 5 reflections

## Goals
* [x] Understand Encapsulation in OOP
* [x] Understand SRP in OOP
* [x] Understand inheritance in OOP
* [ ] Boris bike pairing challenge

## Reflections

* After spending time looking through the definitions of Encapsulation and SRP I felt much better about what these concepts meant. 
  However the best way for me to fully understand them involved me coming up with analogies for these concepts and then explaining them to someone else. 
  
* The boris bike challenge was good. I did not progress any further than I had on previous days, but going over previous steps again really helped cement my knowledge of raising errors in your code and tests. As well as better understanding some principles of programming.

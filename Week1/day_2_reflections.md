# Day 2 reflections

## Goals: 
* [ ] Debugging 
* [ ] Pair programming 

## Reflections

-> The key thing I need to rememeber about debugging is the mantra:
    "Tighten the loop; Get visibility"

-> Remember that debugging is the 'process of removing bugs from a program' 

-> When debugging, the main part of increasing visibilty and the *stack trace* is to identify the **exact** line which is causing the issue.

-> Mastering debugging was very difficult but the main thing to remember is the line above^

-> I was reminded today what the difference between forking and cloning a repository was. And how to initialise a github repo and push/pull to/from it. 
   This was very useful for pairing with someone else this afternoon remotely and pushing our new commits to the same repo. 
   
-> I learnt what a user story is and how we can extract a domain model from a user story (basically the objects of the domain model are the nouns in the user story, while the messages are the verbs)

-> learnt about using irb for running a feature test, as well as what a *feature test* was. 

-> started the main steps to any project:
   * make the directory
   * init the git 
   * install the rspec (test software) 
   * init rspec and set up a spec file
   * set up a unit test
   * code to pass the test
   * move between feature and unit test

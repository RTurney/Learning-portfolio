#Day 4 reflections

##Goals
* [x] Gain more confidence in TDD
* [ ] Boris Bike challenge

##Reflections

* I am quite confident in my understanding of TDD and why we do it. I will still want to spend more time reading about it though, so I can fully understand all the benefits compared to just standard coding. 

* I understood the difference between **require** and **require_relative** which is very useful 

* Further cemented my understanding of the **attr_acessor** (including attr_reader and attr_writer)

* Better understand github and how to fork/make pull requests. 

* Used the initialise method in the boris bike challenge.

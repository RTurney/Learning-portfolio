# Week 5 day 2

# Goals:

* [ ] group project - Makers BnB 

## Reflections

* I had a chat with Katrina first thing this morning. She reminded me that I only need to concentrate on my own learning and that I should not compare my own work to others. Or, at least, to compare fairly. 

* Today went really well. I am very pleased with how our team is cooperating together. I think our team is working much more cooperatively than we were yesterday. 

* First thing we covered this morning was our team charter and the XP values. I think I will need to read through the XP values more thoroughly as they were very interesting. 

* The biggest thing we learnt today was Sinatras Active::record gem which allows for easy working with databases. I would be lying if I said I had an advanced understanding of it but I think I get the basics and can certainly see the advantages of using it.

## Reflections 

* After looking through the README from yesterday with our goals from today, I feel much more accomplished about how much we have managed to do today. 

* I especially need to remind myself about how much I have been able to implement or complete each day in my last job. This feels like so much more in comparison. 

* Overall feeling very good about today. I am excited to do more regarding the styling of the webpage tomorrow/tonight.

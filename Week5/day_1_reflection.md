# Week 5 Day 1 

## Goals 

* [x] Code review - weekend challenge 
* [ ] Group project - Makers BnB

##Â Reflections 

* I feel a bit disappointed in myself regarding my performance in the weekend challenge. I feel as though I could've gotten much further in the user stories and saw how well others had done in the challenge. 

* I had positive feedback for the code review, which was nice.... Need to remind myself that there is no positive and negative feedback, only feedback. 

* I have realised that I need to be better at detailing how to run/work my code within the README's. Also detailing the process of how I have developed the code in another README may also be useful and very descriptive. 

* The group project went well today 

* Learning about the 'mvp' and establishing that for our project was a key moment for designing how we will work. I will keep this in mind for all future projects. (Also about starting with a skateboard when designing a car) 

* Learnt about how to create issues within the repo on github. Also about how to create branches and then create pull requests to merge branches with master branch. 

* Found out how difficult it could be to work in a group on a project. Not because of the group members but because of how difficult be to merge branches without confilcts and ensuring you are all working with the same variables to the same project. Difficult balancing act. I look forward to seeing how we will overcome this during the week.

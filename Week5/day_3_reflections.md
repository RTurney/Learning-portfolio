# Week 5 day 3

## Goals 

* [ ] group project - Makers BnB 
* [x] establish a user sign in
* [x] allow a user to sign out 

## Reflections

* Feeling really positive about our project so far! I feel like we are making great process and are working very well together as a team. 

* We learnt how to do user sign ins and sign outs today which was very useful as I had not covered that yet. It was much easier than I had assumed it would be.

* I have a much better understanding of how ActiveRecord and db:migrate work now after today. I can certainly see why they are so useful as we have not had to build any unit tests or any signifcant classes to build database objects. 

* Postive feedback regarding our project from the coah, which was nice. 

* Learnt about how to randomise the background colour of a webpage in css 

* Finally used a before loop in rspec and saw the reason for doing so. Feels good to actually be using these methods in our tests finally. 

* Learnt more about good commit and issue raising conventions. 

* Overall, a great day!

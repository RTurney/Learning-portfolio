## Weekly reflections:

Overall I think this week went really well. I felt much more confident in Ruby on rails knowledge and was able to work on rails quite effectively. 
I think this is a result of the instagram challenge from the weekend prior. The challenge and setting up the articles demo from the rails guide really helped meunderstand what was going on with rails' routing system and controllers. 

I am also impressed with how well we worked regarding agile development and our 2 day sprints. While I do not think I learnt alot this week, I definitely think I learnt some valuable lessons. Particularly from our mistakes. We came across some major issues Thursday evening before the demo and found that using an online parser to translate our bootstrap.min.css files had caused a heap of issues with our rspec tests. I was not aware that rspec tests could fail as a result of css but now I am very aware of it. And I will no longer try and translate bootstrap.min.css files into regular css files, as they do not get translated perfectly. 
Furthermore, we had some issues with our rspec tests failing as a result of our test environment and our posts. I am still uncertain as to why this has occurred but I have learnt to **COMMIT REGULARLY** and **TEST REGULARLY** no matrer how small your changes. It helps when it comes to identifying issues and saving as much of your code as possible when bugs need to be removed. 

I think our end project was solid but after seeing what others had also accomplished, I wish we had been able to do more and solve more of our issues. Also I think I need to improve my presentation style and approach. But that is an issue outside of Makers. 

### Note: 
I realise I have missed all of my learning logs for this week due to the busy-ness of this week's project. I will need to make sure I make time for my learning log during this next week and the following group project.

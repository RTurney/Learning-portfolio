# Week 4 day 3 

## Goals 

* [ ] Domain modelling workshop - CRC cards and databases
* [ ] Pair programming challenge

## Reflections

* The domain modelling workshop was difficult. I feel like I do not fully understand how to set up my own CRC cards. I will need to spend more time reading around these subjects in order to increase my knowledge and confidence on this topic.

* The pair programming challenge went really well. My pair had a really good environment set up and I would like to emulate that on all my own projects. I will need to set up ohmyzsh on my own laptop. 

* Also I was very impressed by his use of a layout.erb file for his html styling which I will be using from now on. 

* Additionally, was very impressed by his README file. I will try to do the same from now on in my own README's. Or set up a 'development_process.md' file to cover the READMEs during the weekend projects. 

* We worked very well together and managed to set up a full stack feature for the pair project without the walkthrough. Was impressed that we managed to solve our own error messages as well. 

* Overall a great day. Has made me want to do furter research into style guides for ruby and rspec as well to better my own knowledge. 

* I'm also considering setting up a daily rating for each day on how I feel. Might allow me to monitor where my good and bad days are a bit better. If so, I would give today a: 7/10

# Week 4 day 1 reflections

## Goals

* [ ] Understand MVC framework 
* [x] Mocks, doubles and stubs workshop 
* [ ] Pair programming challenge - Bookmark manager 
* [x] code review our peer's work 

## Reflections

* I realised that I did not keep up with my learning log very well last week so I will have to make a much more concerted effort to do this **daily**

* I really enjoyed the weekend challenge and I feel as though I did quite well at it. HTML was quite fun to work with and it was nice to see your code create something presentable and tangible. 

* The code review went well and I also asked the coaches to provide a review of my code as well. The feedback was very useful and I will edit my code to accomodate the reviewers comments. 

* The doubles workshop was less useful than I thought it would be as I had already started the workshop previously. However, I learnt about using doubles as described classes and also better convention on where to declare them. 

* I did not get much time to look into the MVC framework this morning due to the workshop. I definitely deel as though I will need more reading to understand the framework a bit more and it was definitely not something I was keeping in mind during the challenge over the weekend. 
However, doing the pair programming challenge this afternoon definitely helped my understanding of what is meant to mean. I will still need to spend time getting an in-depth understanding though.

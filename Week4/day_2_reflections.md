# Day 2 Week 4 

## Goals 

* [x] Understand what a webframework is 
* [x] Understand MVC 
* [x] Bookmark manager pair programming challenge

## Reflections

* I really enjoyed everything I learnt today 

* I feel much better about webframeworks, Sinatra, DSLs, Rack and MVC. Just spending some time to read through the definitions of these concepts was very useful for me. Also talking out-loud/ rubber ducking the definitons of these concepts, especially in my own words, was very useful for helpig my understanding. I will be using that technique alot more going forward when I want to understand something better. Also, coming up with my own analogies was really helpful for my understanding. 

* The SQL database stuff was quite difficult and I fekt quite tired afterwards. I understood it all though! It was still very exciting and I'm happy with all we got through this afternoon, but it was just alot of new stuff. 

* I think spending some more time playing with databases using SQL will help further my understanding.

* The area I am least confident about is using Ruby with SQL to edit/view your data from your database in your code. I will need to play with that more over the next week to help my understanding/confident.

# Week 4 Day 5 

## Goals

* [x] self-led learning: learn more about databases and sql language
* [x] complete the sql murder mystery
* [x] visit the demo day event for finishing students
* [x] pair programming 

##Â Reflections

* Overall I think the self-led learning went very well. I managed to complete the sql murder myster (no spoilers) which was very good for teaching me sql commands, in particular, the <JOIN> command which can be used to join tables by ids during a search. 

* I also started the SQL zoo, but I think it would have been more benefical for me to start that before doing the SQL murder mystery. It felt rather simple after that exercise. 

* I feel much more confident now regarding SQL and understanding relational databases. 

* The demo-day was very interesting! Was shocking to see what quality of product we will be expected to create. Learnt alot about how the concept forming idea works though. 

* The retro was very informative. The coach explained why we would wrap an object around a database which really helped my understanding. Feel beter about it now but I would not say I am _confident_ with it. 

* Pair programming went well! Took it slow which was nice. definitely needed to go over some of the earlier steps again.

* Also found out the differences between a test/development/production environment and what each is used for. 

* Covered over how to set a test and development environment again. 


## Weekly reflection

Overall I do not feel the most confidence with databases and working with them. I certainlly feel like I have a long way to go before I am confident with databases and SQL. 
However it was exciting to learn something new and finally understand what SQL is and why it is important.

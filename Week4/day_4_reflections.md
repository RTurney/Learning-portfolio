# Week 4 Day 4

## Goals

* [x] set up oh-my-zsh on my terminal 
* [x] clean up my work folders 
* [ ] birthday app 
* [ ] finish guess-the-number game
* [ ] pair programming challenge

## Reflections 

* I am really happy with setting up oh-my-zsh on my computer. It was a fairly issue-free process and the terminal looks much better and has some added features such as 'syntax highlighting' which is very useful. 

* Setting up the birthday greeter app went very smoothly and it was good to go over the set-up process again for setting up the environment for developing a web application. Also by going through Josh's bookmark manager application, it was great to see what each gem is useful for and how to nicely set up your project

* I used rubocop to learn some ruby style conventions which was very useful and I feel pretty good about that.

* The pair programming challenge was very difficult today. I realised that we had not completed the step from yesterday the way the walkthrough intended. While I was happy that we had found an alternative method to complete the step, I feel like we missed the point of what we were doing. 

* Although we went over the walkthrough for yesterday's step today, I did not fully understand the need for wrapping an object around the database. I will need to read more into this subject. 

* Again, as with the previous step, we managed to complete the step today seperately from how the walkthrough wanted us to complete it. We tried to adjust our method to use the 'delete "/" { }' for calling a page and it kept failing and I do not understand why. Additionally, I do not know why we would need to use that as I managed to make the process work regardless. Will need to read around this subject as well.

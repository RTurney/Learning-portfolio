# List of terminology and definitions:

This is a list of terms or names that I do not fully understand and would like to look into further. 
I will break this down into several areas. 
1) No idea - this section will include terms that I have no concept about and need to improve on. 
2) Slight understanding - concepts that I kind of get but only have a shallow understanding of
3) Full understanding - I have a deep understanding of these terms and understand their use in programming 

Rules of this document:
Each concept will move up into a higher tier. I will ~~strikethrough~~ each concept/term as it leaves a tier into a higher one.

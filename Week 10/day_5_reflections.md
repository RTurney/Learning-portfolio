# Week 10 day 5 

## Goals: 

* [x] Read about linter 
* [ ] Read about githooks
* [ ] refactor and properly stub guessing game 
* [x] Start blackjack in Ruby 

## Reflections:

* I ended up taking a good part of the afternoon off, which means I did not get some of my jobs done. 

* I have started my blackjack project in Ruby. I want to use it to show off what I can do. 

* I would also like to start a pet/tamagotchi project.

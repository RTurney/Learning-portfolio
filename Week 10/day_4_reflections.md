##Â Reflections

* Yesterday ended up being quite busy between the ideation workshop for next week's project and having a catch-up with Miranda. 

* Overall I only really worked on finishing the Gilded Rose yesterday afternoon. So the other goals will have to be moved to tomorrow 

* I really enojoyed the Gilded Rose, now that I understood what it was trying to teahc me, it just felt like a puzzle. Really enjoyed it and I pklan to use it to help me in other languages.

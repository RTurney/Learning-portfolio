## Weekly reflections:

I have really enjoyed this week and having more time to myself, to do my own learning. My review went well and I believe I had done some good work with my tech tests. I feel so much more confident in my process now and can trust in it when working on code. I also feel really happy with the process and my progress through Makers. I can not only see my progress with my coding but I also understand so much more about software development in a commercial setting and I think that is something which does not show at first.

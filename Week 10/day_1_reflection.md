# Week 10 day 1

## Goals:

* [ ] Complete Bank tech test
* [x] Finish application to AND


## Reflections:

* It was nice to have some time to myself again and begin self-learning. It was quite refreshing. 

* The tech test was not too difficult to get started. I started reading about best practices and I started learning about README-driven development, which was quite interesting. I have taken onboard the concepts of RDD and have implemented it within my tech test. I want the best looking result I can get. Additionally, I think the Readme driven development will be very useful for my review this afternoon. 

* Working through the tech test was good using the TDD process. I need to ensure that I make less severe jumps in logic and testring though, as I made some sections more difficult then I needed to. I will need to remember this for my REVIEW today. 

* The final section of the tech test has been a bit more difficult. Hopefully I will find a way to iterate through my transaction history to print out a table tomorrow.

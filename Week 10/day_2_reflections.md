# Week 10 day 2

## Goals:

* [x] Finish bank tech test
* [x] Review

## Reflections:

* Overall I think the day went really well! I am happy with both my tech test and the review.


* I am happy with the tech test. It has shown me that I need to go through and make alot more effort with my READMEs as that can really transform a project! Also its not too difficult to make a good readme, particularly if you start with one and use README driven development. 


* However I realised after seeing other's tests that my own edge case finding could be much better. I will need to think more from now on about the inputs and outputs of a project before I jump into it. Also modelling the problem before starting could help me with identifying classes and methods needed. As some of my classes may have become too bloated without me realising. 


* My review went well even though I was nervous about it. I felt myself stalling alot more this time during the coding process, but managed to save myself by always going back to the easiest thing imaginable to pass tests and then coming back to do the harder thing during refactor. 


* Also I was praised for always refactoring during my TDD cycle, which I will need to remember to keep doing. 


* Apparently I missed a commit during one of my green stages, so my reviewer suggested I use 'git hooks'. I will need to read about those.

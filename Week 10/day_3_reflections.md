# Week 10 day 3 

## Goals:

* [x] Start Gilded Rose tech test
* [x] Javascript kata
* [x] Learn about jest
* [x] Process workshop 

## Reflections:

* The process workshop went well. I think I should go to more, but I definitely think the reviews provide more, and better, feedback. But still, it was good to get feedbsck from my peer and speak to them about process. 

* I forgot why I do not like javascript. There are some differences in the language which always catch me off guard. I need to spend some time seriously trying to learn the language and the rules. 

* Jest was easy enough to get into. Very similar to most other testing languages I have worked with. If it is one which is used currently, I am happy to say I can code in it. 

* It took me a while to get my head around the Gilded rose challenge but once I understood what I was supposed to do, I began to find it really enjoyable.

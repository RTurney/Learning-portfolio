## Weekly reflection

Overall, I had very little energy this week. I had to take a day off on Monday to give myself a rest from the previous week. 
This can also be seen by the fact that I have not done any of the daily reflections for this week. 
I also had very little energy for learning this week as a result of the burn-out and that has led me to feeling like I have fallen behind this week and not enjoying the week as much. 

If this week has taught me anything, it is not to push myself too far as it will only ruin my learning for the week after. 

One of the main thing I learnt about learning a second language is that translation is the best way to do it. By actively learning the key aspects of the language which you use frequently and using a previous project as a scaffold, that can really help you understand a new language very quickly.

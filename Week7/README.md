## End of week reflections

Initially I felt okay at the end of this week. But once again I felt completely overwhelmed by starting the weekend project and I did not feel compelled to do the challenge, which contrasts greatly with how I worked on challenges in the first bunch of weeks. 
I think I just hit a wall and get very overwhelmed with how much I don't know even just to get started on the challenges now. Which puts me off doing them. And then I feel guilty for not doing them and the cycle continues. 

What I feel I need is some sort of list or structure of goals, which I know I should be able to accomplish. Or just a week off for me to recollect myself... which can't happen of course. I think some of my key issues are time and energy; I do not feel like I have enough time to learn everything I would like to, to feel comfortable but also, I do not always have the energy to learn and push through new concepts.

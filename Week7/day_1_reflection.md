# Week 7 day 1 

## Goals

* [x] Code review 
* [x] Begin and plan a group project

## Reflections

* I feel alot more energy and drive to learn than I did last week. I think that is an indicator that I need to do something fun at the weekend and I should concentrate on fun challenges if the main weekend challenge is...lackluster. 

* The code review went well. I feel like I was a bad reviewer as I did not fully understand the code, not having done the same challenge at the weekend. 

* Additionally, I received feedback on my Airport challenge which I would like to update during the week. 

* Started the group project. I think we have taken a good approach to starting the challenge and I feel as though I have learnt alot from the previous group challenge. I now believe the best way to start these kind of projects is by devising a group charter and then deciding on the MVP of the application. that really helps give shape to what is important about the code and highlighst what needs working on first.

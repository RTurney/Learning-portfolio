# Week 7 day 2 

## Goals: 

* [x] Practice for Review 
* [x] Review 
* [x] Group project - NotePad App 

## Reflections: 

* I felt quite disappointed in how I performed during the Review. I feel like I just lost my ability to TDD during the review and I am really disappointed in my own code. 
I have learnt that Reviews can be quite stressful without realising it and it is very easy to lose your TDD. Getting a good process is one of the most important things to being a good developer. I learnt that it is better to take lots of small steps in your testing rather than big ones, as you will be more likely to trip yourself up. 

* Otherwise though, I knew that the Review was going to be difficult and that others have struggled with it as well. The best thing I did before going in was realising that negative feedback was good and that it would be better for me to go in and do poorly rather than go in and perfect it. I will have more to learn and develop in my process, which is of course, a good thing. 

* It was good to see how to easily build your own unit and feature tests by using the error codes to guide you. 

* Learnt about the DOM and how to reference it using javascript.

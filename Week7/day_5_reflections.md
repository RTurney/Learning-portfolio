* [x] Group project

## Reflections

* After speaking with one of the Coaches, I have decided that I am going to make some changes to how I track my learning:
    1. First, I will try and do a ruby/javascript kata every day 
    2. Second, I will keep track of terms I am unfamiliar with and monitor my understaing of these terms 
    3. I will also be monitoring the progress of my languages, particularly monitoring my javascript (which I have self-learnt) against the Ruby (which I was walked through)
    4. I will be doing these forms in the morning and ensuring that I decide upon my daily learning goals as I go on, rather than in the evening when it was easier to forget to do it and not do these reflections. I will be starting each morning with a reflection on my learnings and deciding where I want to go next. 

* I feel much better about my javascript after assessing my learning against my Ruby. I will need to keep looking back at this to ensure that I am progressing in my javascript and to help grow my confidence.

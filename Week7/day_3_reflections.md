# Week 7 day 3 

## Goals: 

* [ ] NotePad - group project 

## Reflections

* Did not really cover much new concepts today which was a bit disappointing. 

* I am looking for self-led learning time tomorrow.

* I have a growing list of concepts that I wish to learn about:
  * [ ] agile development
  * [ ] AJAX
  * [ ] JSON
  * [ ] DOM 
  * [ ] Javascript 
  * [ ] HTML 
  * [ ] CSS
  and many more
Hopefully I will find time to cover these things tomorrow and this weekend.

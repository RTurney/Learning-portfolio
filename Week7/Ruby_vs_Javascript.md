# Language comparison

This is a file to compare my knowledge between my Ruby and Javascript 
Ruby was my first language that I was taught by Makers. It was taught to me in a much more structured way and I believe it gives a good set of goals on what I should be able to do in other languages. 
And so here I will list what I am capable of doing in Ruby and use this is a learning guideline for Javascript.

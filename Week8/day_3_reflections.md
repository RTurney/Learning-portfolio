# Week 8 day 3 

## Goals:

* [x] Talk to Alex about the issues I was having over the past two weeks
* [x] Talk to the team about our approach to this project 
* [ ] Understand routes in ruby on rails 
* [x] Get our project to deployment 


## Reflections:

* The talk with Alex was nice. I had already made some adjustments to my learning approach these past few days such as: 
    1. Getting up earlier so that I can do my daily reflections and plan my goals before the day begins 
    2. Working extra time every other evening to further my own knowledge. Whilst having every other evening off to relax
    3. Deciding to compile a list of learning objectives that I would needed to have achieved over the past two weeks, so that I can determine whether I have reached those learning goals and feel better about my own project. 

* He also talked to me about 'feeling like a failure' and pointed out that you are **not a failure** if you do not understand something. Not everyone will get something straight away and may need time. It is nothing against you if you cannot do something. And don't forget to **give yourself a break**. We ahve to manage burnout intelligently, its a very real thing and can have very real consequences for your learning if you push yourself too far. 

* We managed to get out app deployed to Heroku and then set up automatic deployment from the github main branch using circleci. It feels fantastic to have these things fully set up now so we can have continuous integration and start working in an agile way! 

* We have also set up some routes now between our pages so that users will be able to navigate around the website 

* Honestly I just feel very accomplished witha ll we have been able to do with this web app so far. I feel like it has really been coming together.

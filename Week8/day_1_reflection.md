## Reflections

* So it appears I was not alone in my inability to do the news summary challenge. It looks like many of my colleagues also struggled to get started in the weekend challenge. As bad as that is, it does give me some comfort that I was not the only one who had some issues with this challenge. 

* Additionally, after talking to some of my peers I have also learnt that I am not alone in feeling completely lost over the last two weeks and not enjoying them as much. 

* I think I need to read over some of the goals from these last two weeks and establish what learning outcomes I was supposed to meet. Then I will try and ensure I can reach these goals, with evidence. 

* Unfortunately, although I sent the coaches a message on their channel. No coaches have reached out to me after my call for support. I should either reach out to the channel again or just wait until my meeting with Alex on Wednesday. 

* I also need to start the news summary challenge again so that I can learn more about APIs. One of my peers suggest that I work through the API pill from the week project. This might be the best way for me to learn what is happening during the API call and how I can use this data.

# Week 8 day 2

## Goals:

* [ ] Go through API pill 
* [ ] Learn how to use ruby on rails 
* [x] Group project 
* [x] Learn about pipelines


## Reflections:

* The group work yesterday was quite frustrating in the end as none of us knew how Ruby on rails works and thus we were left going in circles. 

* Additionally I believe our approach to this project has been incorrect and instead of jumping straight into the coding, we should have been prepaing for each 2-day sprint and determining story points for each sprint before moving forward. Furthermore, I think our first steps should have been setting up the pipeline for deployment as well as deploying the application on Heroku. 

* Learning about how to set up a pipeline was incredibly useful for understaing how continous integration works and how deployment works in the development world. I feel much better about my understanding of these concepts now and I think I know how we should be accomplishing this for our team as well. 
    Resources I used:
    https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/hello-world/?section=getting-started
    https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#deploy-the-app
    

* I am looking forward to tomorrows work.

## Weekly reflection:

I feel so much better this week then I did the previous week. I had a really porr start to this week after completely failing to start the weekend challenge and already feeling like a failure from the previous two weeks. 
However, starting a new framework and working in a group project was a big help for me feeling much more confident again and being able to move forward in my learning. 
From now on I will need to take a step back when I am struggling and reach out to others. It was so helpful to see that I was far from the only one who struggled and did not enjoy the past two weeks. 

Moving forward, this week was really good. Rails is a complex framework, mostly because it is so opinionated and does not allow for much in the way of 'freestyle coding'. So I will need to learn alot more about it this weekend. However I feel good about learning about pipelines and how to set up a project to automatically deploy once it is pushed to the main branch! That feels like a big step to understanding how software development works in a commercial setting. 
Also learning about Agile development over two day sprints was also really helpful for understanding commercial working environments.

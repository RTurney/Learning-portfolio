# Week 2 Day 4

## Goals 

* [x] Self led learning: learn about polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction
* [ ] Oystercard challenge

## Reflections 

* Feeling very confident with my understanding of the OOP principles. It was helpful to talk through these principles with a peer or a rubber-duck 

* The oystercard challenge went well, I was introduced to how to srp your class/methods so that it would make extracting a class much easier. Was very useful, feel confident I could mirror this myself.

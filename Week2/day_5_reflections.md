# Week 2 Day 5

## Goals 

* [x] Learn about doubles, mocks, stubs, fakes, spies and dummies. 
* [ ] Oystercard Challenge

## Reflections

* The self-led learning went vent well. I feel like I understand doubles alot better.

* I understand some of the basics regardng mocks, stubs, fakes and spies, although, a few days later I find it difficult to fully remember the differences between these concepts. I will need to cover them again. 

* The oystercard was frustrating again, stuck on the same step with extracting classes. 

* However, it was useful to go over the process to srp a class and make it easier to extract a class from it. 

* I understood how difficult it could be to work on someone's code which you did not fully understand.

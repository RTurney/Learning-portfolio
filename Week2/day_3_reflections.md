# Week 2 Day 3 

## Goals 

* [x] Feedback workshop 
* [ ] Oystercard pairing challenge
* [ ] Airport challenge

## Reflections

* Learning about how to give and receive feedback was incredibly helpful. 

* I think the most important thing was about how to receive feedback. It is important to remember that there is no good and bad feedback, there is only feedback. Feedback is your friend and will only let you improve yourself. 

* Learnt alot about github today and how to return to a previous commit as well as how to branch from a previous commit

* Learnt about how to use a double during your testing to stand in for another object or class. Was able to use it successfully during the airport challenge. 

* Learnt about the let command for assigning doubles

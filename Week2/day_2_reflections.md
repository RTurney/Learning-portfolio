# Week 2 day 2

## Goals

* [x] Understand domain modelling
* [ ] Pair programming challenge
* [ ] Airport challenge

## Reflections

* The domain modelling workshop was incredibly useful. I feel much more confident how I can break down user stories into the domain and a domain model. 

* The domain modelling sheet provided a really useful framework and process to break down user stories. I was able to use this for the Airport challenge, as it essentially allowed me to form the classes and methods for a program just from the user stories. 

* The pair programming challenge went well, I went over some of the steps from the previous day and it was useful to cover them again. 

* The airport challenge was very good for covering the TDD cycle again. 

* The domain model workshop made starting the Airport challenge very easy. I could basically write the airport program directly from the worksheet.

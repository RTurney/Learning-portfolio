# Week 2 day 1 

## Goals 

* [ ] understand the definition of stubs, mocks, doubles in rspec
* [x] code review a pair partner's code 
* [x] Oyster card pair programming challenge

## Reflections

* I did not get the time to look into the definitions of stubs, mocks and doubles. I will have to repeat this goal later in the week 

* Code review went well. The process seems quite simple through Github. I know understand the pull request system much better as well.
  I will need to practice this process some more so I get used to reading other people's code. 

* Learnt about correct spacing for curly braces { } 

* Learnt about creating a Gemfile to list gems necessary for a project. Need to learn more about it though as I do not feel fully confident about it. 

* Learnt about helper and conventional files in Rspec, however I feel as though I need to learn about these in more detail, as again, I do not feel fully confident about the purpose of these files. 

* Saw a good way to use the private method for your attr_writer/reader/accessor methods. Should use this in the future

* Learnt about how attr_writer and accessor methods require the use of self.variable when overwriting/changing a variable but only the variable name when reading. 

* Learnt some more conventions for rspec which I will need to use in the future in my code

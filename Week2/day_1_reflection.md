# Week 2 day 1 

## Goals 

* [ ] understand the definition of stubs, mocks, doubles in rspec
* [x] code review a pair partner's code 
* [x] Oyster card pair programming challenge

## Reflections

* I did not get the time to look into the definitions of stubs, mocks and doubles. I will have to repeat this goal later in the week 

* Code review went well. The process seems quite simple through Github. I know understand the pull request system much better as well.
  I will need to practice this process some more so I get used to reading other people's code.
